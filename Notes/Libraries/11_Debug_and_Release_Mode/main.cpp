/*
    *) Debug and Release Mode:
        -> while build you program there are two different ways you can build the program
            1) Debug Mode
                -> the process of finding and eliminating the bugs in the program is called debugging
                -> the debug mode gives the programmers access to a lot of extra information and tools that can help a programmers track down the flows in the program
                -> in this mode the compiler will generate the debug information
                -> in this mode the compiler will not optimize the code
                -> the downside of this mode that is that program have all of these extra information attached to the program making it slower and larger then it needs to be.
            2) Release Mode
                -> when you are finished debugging the program and you want to distribute it to the users, we should build the program in release mode
                -> release mode build the program and optimize the code as much as possible, making you code lighter and faster.
                -> we can debug the program using the release mode program
                -> but it will be light weight as compare to the debug mode
