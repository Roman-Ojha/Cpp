    *) Std::async   -   Asynchronous execution of a function
        -> using std::async() we can execute a function asynchronously
        -> using std::async() we can multi thread our program
            -> where we can execute multiple functions at the same time
            -> and another task will be executed at the same time as main task
        -> we know about promises and futures:
            -> std::async() returns a std::future object
            -> std::future object is used to get the result of the function
            -> std::future object is used to get the result of the function
                -> which is executed asynchronously
        -> std::async() returns a std::future object
