=> I used : https://github.com/laserpants/dotenv-cpp repo
=> I will just include .header file because it have all the required program to use .env file inside cpp
    => https://github.com/laserpants/dotenv-cpp/blob/master/include/laserpants/dotenv/dotenv.h
=> Now There is an error in line: 375, it uses the 'setenv()' function but that throws error on my computer
=> so rather i will use:
    -> _putenv_s(name.c_str(), val.c_str());

=> after that we will create CMakeList.txt file where i will include the header package
=> Then use vscode extension for CMake build:

=> Or I can use 'cmake' & 'make' command
    -> cmake -S . -B build -G "Unix Makefiles"
    -> cd build
    -> make
    -> now we will get the executable file

=> or we can run the command to build and create executable:
    -> first compile code: g++ -c .\main.cpp -I"include"
    -> create executable: g++ .\main.o -o main.exe
