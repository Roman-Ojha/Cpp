            1) Containers
                    -> Stores data
                    -> use template classes
            2) Algorithms
                    -> sorting
                    -> searching
                    -> use template functions
            3) Iterators (object)
                    -> object points to an element in a container
                    -> handled just like a pointers
                    -> connects algo with containers

        Container:  |1|7|11|18|20|
                      <---|--->     -> using Algorithms
                       iterators
            (moves as instructed by the algorithm)
