/*
1) the concept of reusability in c++ is supported using inheritance
2) we can reuse the properties of an exixting class by inherititing from it
3) the existing class is called the base class
4) the new class which is inherited is called as the derived class
5) reusing classes saves time and money
6) there are different types of inheritance in c++:
    a) single inheritance
        -> a derived class with only one base class
    b) Multiple inheritance
        -> a derived class with more than one base classes
    c) Hierarchical inheritance
        -> several derived classes from a single base class
    d) Multilevel inheritance
        -> deriving a class from already derived class
    e) Hybrid inheritance
        -> *) Hybrid inheritance is a combination of multiple inheritance and multilevel inheritance
           *) a class is derived from two classes as in multiple inheritance.
           *) however, one of the parent classes is not a base class.
