    /*
    Polymorphism in C++ can be of two types:
    1. Compile time polymorphism(Static Polymorphim) (we can say early binding and static binding)
        -> in compile time polymorphism we know that which function will going to call at the compile time , compiler knows which function to call at what time because we had alrady declared the function and call it at the coding time
       Compile time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
        1.1 - Function overloading
        1.2 - Operator Overloading
    2. Run time polymorphism(Dynamic Polymorphism) (we can say late binding as well)
        -> but in here which function will call desision will be taken at the run time
       Run time polymorphism in C++ is acheived using:
        2.1 - Virtual functions
